# Python-Tutorial---Read-File---Hard-Code
Reading txt, csv (Hard Code) (With Jupyter NoteBook)

Here I have discussed few things related to reading of data files.

In this case mainly focused on the hard coding techniques for reading text files. But this method can be also used for reading of CSV files too.

Try to play around the code and understand how to use this way of data manipulations.

This is not the most straightforward way to deal with. But as a beginner this method will helps you to play around in Python.

Thank You !!!
